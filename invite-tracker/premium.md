# Premium

If you are looking to enhance your experience with Invite Tracker, you have come to the right place. **Invite Tracker Premium** offers a large variety of features that are all listed below. But you may wonder why we are even offering a premium version for Invite Tracker in the first place. Well, Invite Tracker requires a lot of CPU and RAM resources to run perfectly 24/7, but to achieve this, it needs to be hosted on a dedicated server for which we are charged a monthly fee. In addition to the bills, Invite Tracker is constantly being updated with new features, which when added together with the amount of maintenance needed, obviously craves a lot of our time. Subscribing to **Invite Tracker Premium** is the best way you can help and support us in its development.
