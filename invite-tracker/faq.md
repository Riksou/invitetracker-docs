# FAQ

## What is the Default Prefix for Invite Tracker?

The default prefix for Invite Tracker is `-`, but you can change it easily, we recommend you read the [server settings](../commands/administration.md#server-settings) section of the documentation.

## Why is Invite Tracker Not Responding to My Commands?

Firstly, make sure the bot is not offline and that there are no current outages by checking Invite Tracker's support server's [outage channel](https://discord.gg/MfTenmfQuP).

If there are no obvious outages, please mention the bot to check if you are using the right prefix. If it does respond, it will tell you the correct prefix you would use in front of commands. \(You can not add any text other than the actual mention for this to work\) 

Lastly, if the bot is not responding to a mention, please make sure Invite Tracker has the right permissions. All of Invite Tracker's required permissions are listed here at [Getting Started](../#getting-started).

## How do I Set Up Invite Roles?

This feature has sadly been disabled because it is against Discord's Developer Terms of Service. Having any features that include rewarding invites just enables server advertisement in either other servers or direct messages. This is something Discord views as unsolicited advertisement, which is exactly what is against the Discord Developer Policy.
