## Getting started

First you need to make sure that **Invite Tracker** is on your server. If not, you can invite it by clicking [here](https://invite.invite-tracker.com/) if you have the permission to.

**Invite Tracker** is by default only asking for the permissions required for it to work, we please you to make sure you are inviting it with the required permissions, otherwise the bot may not work properly. If you want to know more details about why we are asking for specific permissions, read the [FAQ](https://docs.invite-tracker.com/faq).

## Configuration

Once **Invite Tracker** has been invited on your server, if you invited it with the required permissions, it will already be tracking new invites! If you want to have the best experience with **Invite Tracker**, we recommend you to configure the bot [main settings](https://docs.invite-tracker.com/invite-tracker/main-settings) first.
