## Introduction

Invite Tracker is a powerful Discord bot that offers countless amounts of features such as **invite** and **message tracking**, **giveaways** and just so much more. It is also capable of welcoming new users to your server with a **fully customisable** join message feature.

{% hint style="info" %}
Invite Tracker is also offering an advanced **web dashboard** that makes the bot configuration more intuitive and easier. Check it out [here](https://invite-tracker.com).   
More information on how to use the dashboard can be found [here](invite-tracker/dashboard.md).
{% endhint %}

## Getting Started

First, you need to make sure that Invite Tracker is in the server you are looking to use it in. If not, you can invite it by clicking [here](https://invite.invite-tracker.com/).

Invite Tracker is by default only asking for the permissions required for it to work, we please you to make sure you are inviting it with the required permissions, otherwise, the bot may not work properly. If you want to know more details about why we are asking for specific permissions, read the [FAQ](invite-tracker/faq.md).

## Configuration

Once Invite Tracker has been invited on your server, if you invited it with the required permissions, it will already be tracking new invites! If you're wanting to jump right into having Invite Tracker announce new members, you would want to check out Invite Tracker's [configuration](commands/configuration/) commands.

The default prefix for **Invite Tracker** is `-`
